### Description
In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems in three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

* The source code has a interactive shell prompting the user for inputs.
* According to the input the code will import the data and will provide information by computing descriptive statistics.
* Project was coded with the future planning for additional cities/months/years being added later.
* The raw data this project source code needs can be accessed here:
